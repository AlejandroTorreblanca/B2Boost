B2Boost Project.

The project can be imported as a Maven project using the "pom.xml" file.
I have used the compliance version 13 of jdk, but it also works for the version 1.8 of jre and jdk. If there are problems with that just change the Java Built Path and the Java Compiler to the version 1.8.
It is written in Java using Spring Boot. To run the application just execute "DemoApplication.java" as a Java Application.
